h4 Demo Process - When you get here

ol
  li You will register in person on the day(s) of your demo with the TweedLove team at the registration tent at the event village at Nether Pirn Farm, Innerleithen, Scottish Borders, EH44 6PA. We will retain your photo ID (passport or driving license) AND a corresponding debit/credit card as a deposit for the duration of the demo. We will then issue you with a wristband plus a 'Demo ID card' - the wristband and Demo ID will have a corresponding number. 

  li You must register at least 30 minutes prior to their first demo slot - if you don’t register in time, your demo slot may be released. It will be the your responsibility to collect your demo bikes from the correct brands at the correct times. 

  li You will collect your bikes from the brands directly. You will exchange your Demo ID card for the bike. It will be returned when the bike is handed back in good condition. 

  li Demonstration bicycles are the responsibility of the participant is demo-ing/riding the bike, and loss, damage or misuse must be paid in full. In the case of any damage/loss, the brand will be responsible for acquiring payment from the participant (you). 

  li You must return the bikes to the brands at, or before, the end of their demo time slot, and will exchange the bike for your Demo ID card. 

  li After you have finished demo-ing, come back to TweedLove tent with your Demo ID card and corresponding wristband, and exchange these for your original forms of ID (photo ID and credit/debit card). 

  li Done!

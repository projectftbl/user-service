p Pre-booking is available online on a first come first served basis. Further slots will be available for riders on the day (again, first come first served). 

p The demo process is based on attendees following a marked, pre-determined MTB or road demo loop. Both the road and MTB demo loops will take up to an hour to complete for a rider of average fitness. 

p No riders age 12 years old or under are allowed to take part in the demo. Riders under 16 years of age must be accompanied by a riding parent or guardian who is responsible for the child's safety and understands the dangers of the event.
